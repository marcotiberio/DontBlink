          <br>
          Cookies are small text files that websites place in your browser when you visit them. When you return to the
          site, the site can access its previously placed cookie to uniquely identify your browser. Cookies accomplish
          several different things. They recall your preferences at a website, help you view content more efficiently
          and improve the overall user experience on a website. They can also help advertisers see what interests you
          and what advertising may be relevant to you. For further information on cookies, including how to see what

          <br>
          We use cookies to collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address,
          operating system and browser type. We also use cookies to obtain information about your general Internet usage
          and report aggregate statistical information.
          In addition to uses for analytical purposes and for system administration, we also use cookies to report
          aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and
          patterns to understand what products may interest you and show you relevant advertising and promotions.
          <br><br>
          3. WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE?
          <br>

          <br>
          <b>Functionality cookies</b> - These are used to recognise you when you visit the Sweat Entertainment Sites.
          This
          enables us to personalise our content for you (for example show content and links relevant to the country you
          are visiting from), and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of streaming service).
          <br>
          <b>Analytical cookies</b> - They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how
          visitors move

          create actalike or lookalike audiences to show you advertising which we think will be of a legitimate interest
