# DontBlink

Blithe is a brand new pop-star-in-the-making who arrives, as if fully formed, well and truly on a 'Mission', putting her own suburban UK twist on global influences ranging from Pink, Katy Perry and Cardi B to Camilla Cabello. Growing up in Rugby Blithe's dreams never exactly felt close to hand. A restless student, Blithe slowly managed to filter her cheek self-deprecation and irrepressible energy into songs which matched her ambitions. She moved to London aged 16, later honing in on a sound that channels "a dark past, sex and heartbreak" into her forthcoming debut EP.
